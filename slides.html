      But they are sufficiently different from classification to require special treatment

  <section id="slide-org7deeb15">
    <h3 id="org7deeb15">Its easy to find a good baseline for classification</h3>
    <p>
      Some models will work better than others, but a random forest is probably a good default.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-org2ea6345">
    <h3 id="org2ea6345">Not so in recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of standard approaches that are widely used in the literature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example: matrix factorization, winner of the Netflix prize; or user-item space nearest neighbours.

  <section id="slide-org8318b87">
    <h3 id="org8318b87">But these could be virtually useless for your problem</h3>
    <p>
      Do you have a huge number of items? Do new items matter more than old items?
    </p>

    <p>
      Example: at Lyst, we have tens of millions of items, and new items matter more. Never know enough about the new items to use MF.

  <section>
    <h4>Novelty</h4>
    <p>
      Are new items important to your users?
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to incorporate novelty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Continuation</h4>
    <p>
      Do your users return to continue what they were doing before?
    </p>

    <p>
      Make sure you give them recently viewed items or Continue Watching.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Metadata</h4>
    <p>
      Do you have item features?
    </p>

    <p>
      Use content-based or hybrid models.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Popularity</h4>
    Make sure you know if popularity is important, and model it appropriately.
  </section>

  <section id="slide-org1bfae49">
    <h3 id="org1bfae49">When in doubt, ensemble</h3>

    <h3 id="orgfc14fa3">How do you know one model is better than another?</h3>

      Normally, you'd fit some models offline and compute some offline metrics.

  <section id="slide-org7db1852">
    <h3 id="org7db1852">In recommendations, ranking metrics are key</h3>

      Hold out some interactions, fit a model, and make sure the held out interactions are ranked as high as possible.

  <section id="slide-org7c8c3c9">
    <h3 id="org7c8c3c9">Still, recommender system evaluation is difficult</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the problems are common with other systems, but some are unique.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-orgd4d4df9">
    <h3 id="orgd4d4df9">Is your metric correlated with what you care about?</h3>
  </section>
    <section>
      Different customer engagement metrics: clicks vs favourites vs purchases
    </section>

    <section>
      Does any of these uniquely correlate with what you want? Do you need to combine them? What is the right combination?
    </section>

    <section>
      Targeting purchases isn't always the most effective way of optimizing your system for conversion (sparsity of data etc)
    </section>

    <section>
      This extends to A/B test results.

  <section id="slide-org2b273fc">
    <h3 id="org2b273fc">Is the past an accurate predictor of the future?</h3>

  <section id="slide-org3c01b48">
    <h3 id="org3c01b48">Presentation bias</h3>
  </section>
    <section>
      Peculiar to recommender systems.
    </section>

    <section>
      Your training and evaluation data is biased by the effects of your existing system!
    </section>

    <section>
      Highly recommended items more likely to be clicked, making them rank higher in any future system.
    </section>

    <section>
      In the most extreme case, your metrics measure how well your new model tracks your old model.
    </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-orge4ba856">
    <h3 id="orge4ba856">Solutions</h3>
  </section>
    <section>
      Inject randomness into your recommendations, use the data as an unbiased evaluation set.
    </section>

    <section>
      Keep track of your system's decisions; discount interactions on highly ranked items (inverse propensity weighting, censored models, popularity-based negative sampling)
    </section>

    <section>
      Design escape hatches into your system: giving users a way to explore indendently of your system gives you valuable unbiased data.

    <h3 id="orgf7c9670">Classification paradigm</h3>
    <p>
      Train and evaluate model offline.

      Spin up a service that accepts features and returns a prediction.

  <section id="slide-org1d2e258">
    <h3 id="org1d2e258">Recommender systems are a bit more complicated</h3>
    <p>
      Both when it comes to fitting and prediction.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-org92a969d">
    <h3 id="org92a969d">Prediction</h3>
    <p>
      Your system is supposed to construct a ranking: it'll have to make predictions on tens of thousands of items in any single call.
    </p>

    <p>
      This will have to happen quickly. Latency kills the user experience.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-orgd3771fc">
    <h3 id="orgd3771fc">Example: related items</h3>
    <p>
      Pick the most related items among millions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, this involves dot products in some high-dimensional latent space.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-orgfeb8c32">
    <h3 id="orgfeb8c32">Architecture consequences</h3>
    <p>
      Representations have to be local to the computation. Pushing tens of megabytes of data over the wire is infeasible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Have to use clever space partitioning schemes to bound the search space (and the latency).
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-org6ed4d50">
    <h3 id="org6ed4d50">Example: recommended for you</h3>
  </section>
    <section>
      Recommend items to a user.
    </section>

    <section>
      Two-step procedure: candidate generation and ranking.
    </section>

    <section>
      In candidate generation, select and merge candidates from millions of possibilities. These come from your ANN subsystem, popularity, novelty and so on.
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Score in the ranking phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Likely an expensive ensemble.

  <section id="slide-org2798252">
    <h3 id="org2798252">Precompute can't always help you</h3>
  </section>
    <section>
      A lot of these applications have to happen online.
    </section>

    <section>
      It helps to use the context of the interaction to help scoring (time of day, device type, and so on).
    </section>

    <section>
      Crucial to update your representation of the user as they go about interacting with your system.
    </section>

    <section>
      Example: YouTube recommendations adjust in near-real-time to your browsing behaviour.
    </section>
</section>
<section>
  <section id="slide-orgb60b181">
    <h3 id="orgb60b181">Near-line fitting</h3>
  </section>
    <section>
      Often, this means that you have online estimation as well as evaluation systems.
    </section>

    <section>
      Sometimes the whole model is updated online; sometimes only new parameters are folded-in.
    </section>

    <section>
      This means that the model is continuously moving: need to have tools to monitor is health.

    <h3>Practical advice</h3>
    Building your own recommender system?
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
      Understand your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      What constitutes success? Is novelty important? How much data do you have?
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
      Start small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try popularity first.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
      You don't need distributed training.
    </p>
    <p>
      If somebody tries to sell you Hadoop or Spark, they are not your friend.
